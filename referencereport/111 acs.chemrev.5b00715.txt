  7. Exceptional Properties and Device Application: like magnetic, dielectric, electrical transport, optical, optoelectronic and charge storage.

1. Introductions
  The compounds whose general formula could be expressed as CH3NH3(Pb,Sn)(I,Br)3 become the most notably perovskite materials. 
  The possibility for ultra low-cost-per-watt photovoltaic operation originate from the confluence of several factors, including extremely high optical
     absorption, small effective masses (质量) for electrons and holes, dominant point defects (缺陷) that only generate shallow (浅的) levels (能级) and grain
     boundaries that are essentially benign (良性的). 
  The methylammonium cation (CH3NH3 +) may play a role in the special suitability of the hybrid materials for photovoltaic (PV) application, through a low 
     barrier to reorientation within the structure and contributions to the dielectric/ferroelectric properties. 

Some explaination for words:
                                            PV means photovoltaic (光伏)
                                            lead means Pb and tin means Sn

                                            polarizable 可极化的

2. 3D Organic-Inorganic Perovskites
  Perovskite refers to the mineral (矿物) CaTiO3 and any structure adopting the same ABX3 three-dimensional (3-D) structural framework. 
  In the case of organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites, at least one of the 'A', 'B', or 'X' ions are organic. 
  Space filling ionic size constrains dictate (命令) whether a certain set of 'A', 'B', or 'X' ions may adopt the perovskite framework, which involves a 
      corner-sharing network of BX6 octahedra, with the 'A' cations occupying 12-fold coordinated holes within the structure and counterbalancing the 
      charge of the BX3 extended anion. 
  In the perovskites structure, the 'A', 'B' and 'X' cations occupy the apex (顶点) of a cell, the core of a cell and the face center of a cell, resoectively.  
  The Tolerance Factor (t) concept, namely (RA+Rx) = t*2^(0.5) (RB+Rx), where R is the ionic radii for the corresponding ions.
  The nonspherically (非球面地) symmetric (对称的) organic cations and charged complexes have a great challenge to assign (指定) their radii. 
  With the assumption of the molecule being free to rotate (旋转) about its center of mass, Assigning effective radii for organic cations (t=1) becomes
     possible.
  The limit on RA is found to be approximately 2.6 Å for traditional BX3− frameworks with B = divalent metal and X = halogen.
  If A cation is monovalent (单价的) and X cation is a halogen with full occupation, B cation must be divalent (二价的) because of the charge balance. 


Questions:
1. This article mentions that the band gap would be increasing while the degree of the inorganic framework distortion becomes higher. 
      Could I consider it as due to the distortion constraining the electrons' movement ?
