1. Introductions
  The compounds whose general formula could be expressed as CH3NH3(Pb,Sn)(I,Br)3 become the most notably perovskite materials. 
  The possibility for ultra low-cost-per-watt photovoltaic operation originate from the confluence of several factors, including extremely high optical
     absorption, small effective masses (质量) for electrons and holes, dominant point defects (缺陷) that only generate shallow (浅的) levels (能级) and grain
     boundaries that are essentially benign (良性的). 
  The methylammonium cation (CH3NH3 +) may play a role in the special suitability of the hybrid materials for photovoltaic (PV) application, through a low 
     barrier to reorientation within the structure and contributions to the dielectric/ferroelectric properties. 

Some explaination for words:

2. 3D Organic-Inorganic Perovskites
  Perovskite refers to the mineral (矿物) CaTiO3 and any structure adopting the same ABX3 three-dimensional (3-D) structural framework. 
  In the case of organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites, at least one of the 'A', 'B', or 'X' ions are organic. 
  Space filling ionic size constrains dictate (命令) whether a certain set of 'A', 'B', or 'X' ions may adopt the perovskite framework, which involves a 
      corner-sharing network of BX6 octahedra, with the 'A' cations occupying 12-fold coordinated holes within the structure and counterbalancing the 
      charge of the BX3 extended anion. 
  In the perovskites structure, the 'A', 'B' and 'X' cations occupy the apex (顶点) of a cell, the core of a cell and the face center of a cell, resoectively.  
  The Tolerance Factor (t) concept, namely (RA+Rx) = t*2^(0.5) (RB+Rx), where R is the ionic radii for the corresponding ions.
  The nonspherically (非球面地) symmetric (对称的) organic cations and charged complexes have a great challenge to assign (指定) their radii. 
  With the assumption of the molecule being free to rotate (旋转) about its center of mass, Assigning effective radii for organic cations (t=1) becomes
     possible.
  The limit on RA is found to be approximately 2.6 Å for traditional BX3− frameworks with B = divalent metal and X = halogen.
  If A cation is monovalent (单价的) and X cation is a halogen with full occupation, B cation must be divalent (二价的) because of the charge balance. 
  And the +2 charge on the B cation can be achieved by employing equal numbers of +1 and +3 cations. 
  The lone pair s2 electrons or s-orbital hybridization lead metal atom away from crystallographic center of metal halide octahedra, (distortion of the 
      inorganic framework) resulting in alternating (交替的) long and short B-X bonds and the prospects (潜在期望) of ferroelectricity. 

3. Lower-Dimensional Organic-Inorganic Perovskites
  With the dimension reducing, the tolerance factor for 3-D is lifted. (提高)
  The <100>-oriented layered perovskites have a general formula (RNH3)2 An-1 Bn X3n+1 (two octahedra--two B cations, one RNH3 occupies the head 
       and another occupies the tail 头尾各一个, A+ occupies the center of interval). 3-D
  The <110> direction of the 3-D perovskite have a general formula A'2 Am Bm X3m+2 (the octahedra would be cutting in half. 八面体被切割为一半). 
      1-D and 2-D
  The <111>-oriented family, A'2 Aq-1 Bq X3q+3 (透视，各点X都需计入。Becasue of perspective, all the X site should be counted. ). 0-D
  A-R group: 
                    The A must contain terminal functional groups that can ionically interact with the anionic inorganic substructure (基底), but without 
                       the rest of the organic molecule interfering with the inorganic components 'B' and 'X'. 
  2-D perovskite: 
                           There is no definitive restriction for the length of the interlayer organic cation. 
                            But there is a restrictioin for the width, which must fit into area defined by the terminal halides from four adjacent (邻近的) 
                            corner-sharing octahedra. It strictly called steric hindrance (位阻). 
  If organic molecules two narrow, the structure can accommodate by allowing organicmolecules to tilt (倾斜).

3.1 <100>-orientation (RNH3)2 An-1 Bn X3n+1
  Dimensional reduction has significant impact on physical properties. e.g. The band gap increases as the dimensionality of the structure is lowered. 
  The more different set of electronegativities (电负性), the larger band gap of the compounds. 
  In two dimensions between adjacent inorganic layers, the alkyl chains of bilayers are liquid-like (T>Tm)
  Imidazolium (咪唑头) group of the organic cation has steric hindrance to hydrogen bomding (氢键位阻). 
  The buckling of inorganic layers and B-I-B angles have important influence on the crystallography, chemical bonding and the band gaps of the materials. 
  Generally, the large B-I-B angles which indicates that the degree of distortion of the inorganic framework is small leads the narrow band gap of materials. 
  Distortions are determined by the relative charge density and steric requirements of the organic cations. 
  The electronic structure is influenced by there aspects, including B-I-B bond angle, B-I bond distance (or length) and distortion of BI6 octahedra (B=Sn). 
  A convenient way of controlling the in- and out-of-plane distortions is by employing bifunctional organoammonium cations such as 
         Y(CH2)2 NH3+ (Y = OH, Cl, Br, I, CN) in the (Y−(CH2)2 NH3)2 Pb I4
  Upon heating (Br−(CH2)2NH3)2PbI4 (Y=Br) at 50−150 °C, halogen exchange between the organic and inorganic frameworks occurs yielding 
         (Br−(CH2)2NH3)2−x (I−(CH2)2NH3)x Pb Brx I4−x with xmax ∼ 1.85.
  In compound (I(CH2)2NH3)x Pb Brx I4-x, there is strong hydrogen bonding which leads distortion of octahedra and further causes the band gap to increase. 
  In (HO(CH2)2NH3)2 Pb I4 (Y = OH), the CH2CH2NH3 fragment lies within the inorganic layers, with the − OH functional group also playing an active role in 
         hydrogen bonding and with both the inorganic framework and the adjacent organic cation forming supramolecular dimers (超分子二聚体). Consequently, 
         the inorganic sheet are less distorted than Y=I and more distorted than Y=Cl, Br. 
  The ns2 lone pair which manifests (显示) itself as a distortion of the BX6 octahedra and originates from the mixing of the frontier HOMO 
        (highest occupied molecular orbital)−LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) orbitals known as a second-order Jahn−Teller (SOJT) effect that are 
        observed for d0 and ns2 d0 cations. According to this theory, the distortions of the metal centered BX6 octahedra lead to a stabilization (稳定化) of the HOMO 
        and destabilization (不稳定化) of the LUMO, which increases the band gap. 
  The (I3)- and [AuI2]- are related and exchangeable, which is similar to the (I5)- and [AuI4]-. So the (I3)- could be extracted. 
  The linear ion, the thiocyanate SCN− anion, could be used for photovoltaics (PV) and solid state chemistry communities. It was found that incorporation (合并) of 
         a small amount of  Pb(SCN)2 (5 wt %) into the regular two-step solution deposition of CH3NH3PbI3 films resulted in better film qualities with larger grain sizes, 
         which resulted in improved power conversion (转换) efficiencies (PCE) and a noticeable enhancement in the photoluminescence emission quantum yield (产率).  
  Solar cells with a targeted CH3NH3Pb(SCN)2I composition showed similar PCE values to the CH3NH3PbI3 films, but the films containing thiocyanate ions 
         were reported to provide enhanced stability under moist (潮湿的) air.
  Low band gap is an target for potential electro-optical applications. 

  (RNH3)2PbX4, r is number of atoms in the ring of R
     It should be noted that large cross-sectional (横截面的) area organic cations or a geometry (几何形状) that provides steric hindrance are not essential for obtaining 1-D 
         compounds. 
     r=3 (cyclopropylammonium 环丙基胺) to r=6 (cyclohexylammonium 环己基胺) is 2-D, however, r=7 (cycloheptylammonium) gives 1-D chains of 
             corner-sharing octahedra in (C7H13NH3)3PbI5 and (C7H13NH3)3PbBr5·H2O.

3.2 <110>-oriented perovskites  A'2 Am Bm X3m+2
  The [NH2C(1)=NH2]2 (CH3NH3)m Snm I3m+2 series includes formation of hydrogen bonds down the channels of the ⟨110⟩-oriented perovskite layers, 
              and the fact that the iodine atoms of the iodoformamidinium cation complete the 12-fold coordination environment around the methylammonium cation. 
     m = 1−4 members of  the [NH2C(I)=NH2]2 - (CH3NH3)m Snm I3m+2 series include the m = 1, 1-D-chain structures 
          [NH2C(I)=NH2]2 A Sn I5 (A = NH2C(I)=NH2+ or NH2CH=NH2+)
     the m = 2, 2-D-layered structure [NH2C(I)=NH2]2 (CH3NH3)2 Sn2 I8
     while m is increased further, the thickness of the perovskite layers also increases, with m = ∞ corresponding to the 3-D parent perovskite structure. 
      Therefore, this ⟨110⟩-oriented family allows tuning of the dimensionality of the perovskite structure from the 3-D parent structure to various-thickness 2-D 
             layers in the m = 2−4 members, and to 1-D chains in the m = 1 member. 
  
  Some examples:
                           m=1: [CH3SC(=NH2)NH2]3 Pb I5 shows that other organoammonium cations can template this structure.
                           m=2: [C(NH2)3]2 Pb I4 undergoes a ferroelastic phase transition at 307 K. 
                           m=2: (C6H13N3) Pb Br4 (or (C6H13N3)2 Pb2 Br8) is an optically active material featuring a primary amine (伯胺) as a functional group 
                                    attached to the imidazole heterocyclic ring. A ternary ammonium cation in the ring, which asserts steric hindrance for the formation 
                                    of a perovskite framework.
                                           In (C3H11SN3) Pb Br4, the organic cation which combines a primary ammonium and a formamidinium (甲脒) head on the two opposite 
                                           ends of the molecule leads to contorted inorganic layers 

  The highly distorted inorganic framework of this compound can also be described as an assembly of loosely coupled 0-D clusters.

Some Questions:
1. This article mentions that the band gap would be increasing while the degree of the distortion of inorganic framework  becomes higher. 
      Could I consider it as due to the distortion constraining the electrons' movement ? Because it is similar to the effect of electronegativities (电负性)
      on the band gap of the compounds, which shows that more different set of electronegativities leads the larger band gap of the compounds.
