2.1 Semiconductor Properties of Organic Lead Halide Perovskites

  ionic crystals that exhibit semiconducting properties. 

  the optical absorption wavelength of halide perovskites shows a wide variation with the kind and molar ratio of halides (I, Br, Cl) 

  allows easy tuning of band gap and optical absorption by varying the halide ions (I, Br, Cl).
  e.g. (CH3NH3 Pb (Brx I1‑x)3‑y Cly , 0 ≤ x ≤ 1); (HC(NH2)2 Pb Br1‑y Iy, y = 0-1.

  mixed-halide perovskites can form good solid solutions as ionic crystals. 

  CH3NH3PbI3, MA is CH3NH3, a standard perovskite absorber in PV cells

  The valence band (VB) of MAPbI3 consists of approximately 70% of I 5p orbitals and 25% of Pb 6s2 orbitals (lone pair), 
  while the conduction band (CB) consists of a mixture of Pb 6p and other orbitals. 
  This structure is opposite to that of GaAs, in which the VB and CB are formed by p and s orbitals, respectively.

  direct band gap of MA PbI3 and p−p electronic transitions from VB to CB, enabled by the Pb s orbital lone pair, contribute to
   exceptionally high optical absorption coefficients

  The unique defect properties of perovskite are attributed to strong Pb s−I p antibonding coupling, 
  weak Pb p−I p coupling, and its ionic characteristics.
  Weak antibonding coupling between Pb p and I p orbitals fixes the conduction band minimum (CBM) close to the Pb p orbital, 
  and strong Pb s−I p antibonding coupling lowers the valence band maximum (VBM) close to the I p orbital. 

  Therefore, for vacancies (defects) formed by removal of I−, the defect state lies between the Pb p atomic orbital level and the CBM, 
  and for the Pb2+ vacancy, the defect state is formed between the I p and VBM levels. 
  MAPbI3 generate trap states that either reside within the bands (VB or CB) or exist as shallow traps near the CB and VB.

  defect-tolerant is reflected by the large carrier diffusion lengths. 

  MAPbI3 has ambipolar carrier mobility, exhibiting similar effective mass values for both electrons and holes (0.23−0.29), 
   which is a rare property endowed to 赋予 this ionic crystal

  photogenerated carriers in MAPbI3 behave as free carriers, and these carriers can migrate in the perovskite absorber layer without
  recombination for a long time (PL measurements show carrier lifetime of several hundreds of nanoseconds).

It is also considered that high ionic density in halide perovskites helps to suppress recombination between electrons and holes 
by a charge-screening effect 电荷屏蔽 against Coulombic interaction. 库仑相互作用

In summary, the important factors that support high efficiency of perovskite solar cells are the following: 
(1) a high optical absorption coefficient (105 cm -1) that allows the use of a thin film, 
(2) a long carrier diffusion length and suppressed recombination (defect tolerance), and
(3) a well-balanced 均衡的 charge transfer.

One property related to the loss of efficiency that is limits the VOC and efficiency of PSCs is defect (trap) density in halide perovskite crystals
Equally important are the losses caused by interfacial recombination that depend on the properties of other layers in the device.


2.2. Working Principle

electrons from the excited state (LUMO) of the perovskite are injected into the CB of TiO2 and transported through the layer to reach the FTO substrate. 
From there it flows in an external circuit to the counter electrode (cathode), where it combines with oxidized species of electrolyte. 
The reduced 还原的 species then diffuses to the vicinity of the oxidized 氧化的 perovskite to reduce it.

electrons and holes can be transported through the perovskite film itself, without the need for any semiconducting scaffold 支架. 

n-i-p and p-i-n solar cells, where perovskite works as an intrinsic 本征的 absorber sandwiched between two selective contacts (p and n).

  In the n-i-p structure, TiO2 (compact or mesoporous layer) works as an n-type electron transport material (ETM),
  perovskite functions as the intrinsic (i) absorber, 
  and a HTM like spiro-OMeTAD (an organic molecule) works as the p-type contact
  (FTO or ITO/TiO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/metal contact).

  In a p-i-n type structure, which is otherwise known as an inverted 倒置的 architecture, 
  perovskite is sandwiched between a p-type material (for example, PEDOT-PSS) at the bottom 
  and an n-type layer (for example, PCBM) at the top 
  (e.g., FTO or TiO2/PEDOT-PSS/perovskite/PCBM/metal contact). 

the processes of carrier generation, separation, and transport are not as straightforward as they are in amorphous 非晶的 Si p-i-n solar cells.
In p-i-n or n-i-p solar cells, the difference between quasi 准 Fermi levels at the selective contacts (i.e., between p-type and n-type layers) 
 limits the open-circuit voltage.

strong and coherent carrier−lattice coupling effect in perovskite, which was found to be important for both resonant and far-above-gap photoexcitation. 
ultrafast lattice distortions play a key role in the initial processes associated with charge transport.
