Halide Perovskite Photovoltaics: Background, Status, and Future Prospects

2. FUNDAMENTAL STRUCTURE, WORKING MECHANISM, AND MAJOR MILESTONES 里程碑 OF PROGRESS
2.1 Semiconductor Properties of Organic Lead Halide Perovskites

  ionic crystals that exhibit semiconducting properties. 

  the optical absorption wavelength of halide perovskites shows a wide variation with the kind and molar ratio of halides (I, Br, Cl) 

  allows easy tuning of band gap and optical absorption by varying the halide ions (I, Br, Cl).
  e.g. (CH3NH3 Pb (Brx I1‑x)3‑y Cly , 0 ≤ x ≤ 1); (HC(NH2)2 Pb Br1‑y Iy, y = 0-1.

  mixed-halide perovskites can form good solid solutions as ionic crystals. 

  CH3NH3PbI3, MA is CH3NH3, a standard perovskite absorber in PV cells

  The valence band (VB) of MAPbI3 consists of approximately 70% of I 5p orbitals and 25% of Pb 6s2 orbitals (lone pair), 
  while the conduction band (CB) consists of a mixture of Pb 6p and other orbitals. 
  This structure is opposite to that of GaAs, in which the VB and CB are formed by p and s orbitals, respectively.

  direct band gap of MA PbI3 and p−p electronic transitions from VB to CB, enabled by the Pb s orbital lone pair, contribute to
   exceptionally high optical absorption coefficients

  The unique defect properties of perovskite are attributed to strong Pb s−I p antibonding coupling, 
  weak Pb p−I p coupling, and its ionic characteristics.
  Weak antibonding coupling between Pb p and I p orbitals fixes the conduction band minimum (CBM) close to the Pb p orbital, 
  and strong Pb s−I p antibonding coupling lowers the valence band maximum (VBM) close to the I p orbital. 

  Therefore, for vacancies (defects) formed by removal of I−, the defect state lies between the Pb p atomic orbital level and the CBM, 
  and for the Pb2+ vacancy, the defect state is formed between the I p and VBM levels. 
  MAPbI3 generate trap states that either reside within the bands (VB or CB) or exist as shallow traps near the CB and VB.

  defect-tolerant is reflected by the large carrier diffusion lengths. 

  MAPbI3 has ambipolar carrier mobility, exhibiting similar effective mass values for both electrons and holes (0.23−0.29), 
   which is a rare property endowed to 赋予 this ionic crystal

  photogenerated carriers in MAPbI3 behave as free carriers, and these carriers can migrate in the perovskite absorber layer without
  recombination for a long time (PL measurements show carrier lifetime of several hundreds of nanoseconds).

It is also considered that high ionic density in halide perovskites helps to suppress recombination between electrons and holes 
by a charge-screening effect 电荷屏蔽 against Coulombic interaction. 库仑相互作用

In summary, the important factors that support high efficiency of perovskite solar cells are the following: 
(1) a high optical absorption coefficient (105 cm -1) that allows the use of a thin film, 
(2) a long carrier diffusion length and suppressed recombination (defect tolerance), and
(3) a well-balanced 均衡的 charge transfer.

One property related to the loss of efficiency that is limits the VOC and efficiency of PSCs is defect (trap) density in halide perovskite crystals
Equally important are the losses caused by interfacial recombination that depend on the properties of other layers in the device.


2.2. Working Principle

electrons from the excited state (LUMO) of the perovskite are injected into the CB of TiO2 and transported through the layer to reach the FTO substrate. 
From there it flows in an external circuit to the counter electrode (cathode), where it combines with oxidized species of electrolyte. 
The reduced 还原的 species then diffuses to the vicinity of the oxidized 氧化的 perovskite to reduce it.

electrons and holes can be transported through the perovskite film itself, without the need for any semiconducting scaffold 支架. 

n-i-p and p-i-n solar cells, where perovskite works as an intrinsic 本征的 absorber sandwiched between two selective contacts (p and n).

  In the n-i-p structure, TiO2 (compact or mesoporous layer) works as an n-type electron transport material (ETM),
  perovskite functions as the intrinsic (i) absorber, 
  and a HTM like spiro-OMeTAD (an organic molecule) works as the p-type contact
  (FTO or ITO/TiO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/metal contact).

  In a p-i-n type structure, which is otherwise known as an inverted 倒置的 architecture, 
  perovskite is sandwiched between a p-type material (for example, PEDOT-PSS) at the bottom 
  and an n-type layer (for example, PCBM) at the top 
  (e.g., FTO or TiO2/PEDOT-PSS/perovskite/PCBM/metal contact). 

the processes of carrier generation, separation, and transport are not as straightforward as they are in amorphous 非晶的 Si p-i-n solar cells.
In p-i-n or n-i-p solar cells, the difference between quasi 准 Fermi levels at the selective contacts (i.e., between p-type and n-type layers) 
 limits the open-circuit voltage.

strong and coherent carrier−lattice coupling effect in perovskite, which was found to be important for both resonant and far-above-gap photoexcitation. 
ultrafast lattice distortions play a key role in the initial processes associated with charge transport.

2.3. Major Milestones of Progress

flat and dense perovskite film with large grains and high crystallinity is a prerequisite to high efficiency.
a good-quality perovskite film (pinhole-free, large grains) is the basic requirement for a device to perform well.

Almost all parameters involved in the solution processes：
(i) precursor solvent,
(ii) nature, concentration, and ratios of different precursor ions, 
(iii) nature and concentration of additives (besides the active ions), 
(iv) drying temperature, time, and environment(humidity level, controlled solvent or antisolvent vapor exposure), etc.-influence the morphology of the films.

dual functions: one is selective electron extraction as ETM 
and other is provision 提供 of a large surface scaffold 支撑 to accommodate 容纳 perovskite crystals. 

nonporous 无孔 flat ETM film, a dense TiO2 film, or even organic materials such as PCBM
because of the long diffusion length of free carriers (>1 μm) in polycrystalline perovskite films

ETM is regularly coated on transparent conductive substrates such as FTO and ITO,

The existence of a compact layer 致密层 (CL) is essential to ensure selective electron extraction 
and hole-blocking 阻挡 function at the surface of the negative electrode.

mesoporous Al2O3 (which is insulator) layer on the TiO2 CL in a solid-state perovskite device 
produced higher efficiency and Voc compared to those observed with a meso-TiO2-based cell used as reference

mesoporous Al2O3 layer‘s role is to 
accommodate perovskite into its porous network so that carriers are conveyed to the substrate (electrode) through the infiltrated 渗透的 perovskite.
This is, in fact, enabled by the long distance diffusivity of carriers in perovskite.

However, much less work was done on the use of Al2O3 because devices with Al2O3 scaffolds often showed low fill factors 填充系数 (FFs), 
attributed to high impedance 阻抗 of the Al2O3 network
But, the ability to use Al2O3 provided the first evidence that perovskite is capable of transporting carriers over long distances without significant recombination.

SnO2 and ZnO are also used as ETMs

the energy level of the CB significantly influences the Voc and short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc) of the cells. 
Voc in DSSCs is determined 
by the energy gap between the CB level of the semiconductor 
and the redox 氧化还原 potential 电位 of the iodide-based redox agent 氧化还原剂 in the electrolyte (HTM), SnO2, 
having a deep CB level (large work function), always results in low Voc.
But, this is not the case for PSCs.

Perovskite solar cells using SnO2 and ZnO exhibit Voc and Jsc comparable 相当 with those of TiO2-based cells.
The thin metal oxide semiconduct film is current-rectifying 整流 layers with high electron selectivity (hole-blocking ability) in PSCs, 
While such thick metal oxide layers in DSSCs predominantly exhibit bulk semiconductor properties.

in which formamidinium (FA) was mixed with MA. 
This cell achieved 18.4% PCE in the best conditions of film preparation (Figure 10). 
Under the same conditions, an 原子层沉积 ALD-based TiO2 thin layer resulted in lower efficiency of the cell, while Voc values in both cases were same. 
ALD-TiO2-based cell was the photocurrent, which was as low as 5 mA/cm2, in comparison to >20 mA/cm2 obtained with ALD-SnO2

the poor photocurrent in the case of TiO2 was due to band misalignment 未对准 between perovskite and TiO2, forming an energy barrier against electron transfer. 
the greater importance of thin-film properties over bulk properties of metal oxide ETMs in PSCs.

For metal oxide materials, the band gap energy and CB level do not necessarily show good agreement with 
the open-circuit voltage observed in PSCs, probably due to its dependence on the form of material subjected to 受到 measurement. 
Such mismatches of values, if not large, can originate in the differences 
between single bulk crystal and polycrystalline films, film samples in vacuum and in air, and pure and defect rich samples. 

Voc of the device tends to be more influenced by the quality of the perovskite film and its heterojunction interfaces than by the bulk 块状,体积 
properties of the ETM. 

Defects/traps at the ETM/perovskite interface have been found to directly or indirectly influence the cell’s performance, especially J−V hysteresis.

4. COMPOSITIONAL ENGINEERING OF PEROVSKITES

4.1. Mixed Compositions

One major development that has stood out among others and contributed substantially to enhanced stability is
incorporation of different cations in the A-site and different halides in the B-site.

most popular in the recent years is (MA/FA/Cs)Pb(I/Br)3, which is commonly known as a triple-cation-based perovskite. 

The quadruple-cation-based 四重阳离子 perovskite, including Rb (i.e., (MA/FA/Cs/Rb)Pb(I/Br)3) as the fourth cation, 
has also gained interest due to its high cell efficiency and stability.
Recent research has revealed that Rb ion would be expelled out to grain boundaries instead of  occupying the A-site

4.1.1. A-Site Cations Mixture.

Pb 6s 6p−I 5 p interactions lead to generation of the two bands: 
the valence band maximum (VBM) is formed by antibonding (σ*) P b 6 s−I 5p interactions, 
while the conduction band minimum (CBM) is formed by empty Pb 6p orbitals and/or by Pb 6p−I 5 p interactions.

the cations in the A-site are considered not to contribute directly toward the band structure, 
but they play a significant role in providing structural stability by charge compensation 补偿 within the PbI6 octahedra,
largely based on their electrostatic (van der Waals) interactions with the inorganic cage.
Nevertheless, any change in the size of cations in the A-site can either contract 收缩 or expand the crystal lattice, 
thereby altering the optical properties of the perovskite.

Smaller cations like Cs and Rb are expected to contract the lattice and thus increase the band gap, 
while larger cations like formamidinium (FA+) are supposed to expand the lattice and decrease the Eg. 
The article shows that contracting lattice caused the band gap increasing while expanding lattice caused the band gap decreasing. 
Expanding the crystal a bit, resulting in decreased Pb−I bond distance, which eventually lowers the band gap. (VBM Pb 6s-I 5p and CBM Pb 6p and/or Pb 6p-I 5p)

Although based on the Eg value (1.47 eV), FAPbI3 is supposed to perform better than MAPbI3(Eg. 1.55) due to its extended absorption edge (800 nm). 
With an extended absorption edge, FAPbI3 cells show higher photocurrent (Jsc), 
but their efficiency is mainly limited by poor FF, which is possibly related to phase instability of FAPbI3. 

FAPbI3 readily crystallizes into a photo-inactive phase (δ-FAPbI3) at room temperature (RT), 
and this phase is transformed to a photo-active black phase (α-FAPbI3) at temperatures between 125 and 165 °C.
This α-FAPbI3, formed at high temperatures, slowly transforms into δ-FAPbI3when kept at RT. 

a trigonal 三角的 α-FAPbI3 phase is stabilized at RT with a composition of 20 mol% of MA in MAxFA1‑xPbI3 (x = 0.2). 
although the best efficiency is reported (∼18.3%) for FA-based perovskites having a composition of MA0.4FA0.6PbI3. 
MA+, which has almost 10 times greater dipole moment than FA+, is incorporated, 
it exhibits stronger interactions with the [PbI6]4- octahedra 
and thus stabilizes the 3D arrangement of α-FAPbI3 with little lattice shrinkage or changes in the optical properties.

Although the efficiency of FAPbI3 cells falls behind that of the MAPbI3 cells, 
FAPbI3 has a significantly greater thermal stability compared to MAPbI3.
It is proposed that FA has a stronger interaction with iodide and, therefore, does not allow easy breaking of the network. 
It is also explained that FA, being less acidic than MA, does not undergo deprotonation to furnish 提供 HI (the first step of degradation 降解) as easily as MA.

an increased tolerance factor and a stronger interaction of FA with iodide ions, results in greater thermal stability of the FAxMA1‑xPbI3perovskites. 
FA is, unfortunately, more hygroscopic than MA.

Incorporation of the inorganic cation Cs became an alternate choice.
CsxMA1‑xPbI3 (x = 0.09) shows better performance (18.1%) and thermal stability (no color change when heated at 120 °C for 3 h) 
than pristine MAPbI3 (15.8%), while a higher concentration of Cs shows surprisingly worse stability. 
The unencapsulated Cs0.09 MA0.91 PbI3 cell retains above 80% of its initial performance, 
whereas the performance of the pure MAPbI3 cell deteriorates to less than 40% of its initial performance after heat treatment at 85 °C for 60 min. 
Regular MAPbI3 degrades completely when heated at 200 °C for 10 min, changing its absorption edge to that of PbI2, 
while the absorption spectrum of Cs0.05 MA0.95 PbI3 remains almost unchanged under the same treatment conditions.
Moisture stability is improved by Cs inclusion in the perovskite.

Small and large tolerance factors respectively for CsPbI3 (τ = 0.85) and FAPbI3 (τ = 0.98) stabilize the perovskites 
in orthorhombic 正交 (yellow) and hexagonal structures
the effective tolerance factor can be tuned to form a cubic structure (0.9 ≤ τ ≤ 1) by alloying CsPbI3 with FAPbI3 (FAxCs1‑xPbI3) over a range of proportions 比例.

FAPbI3 perovskites including either Rb or K have demonstrated improvements in the PV performance of the cells.

a small amount (x ≤ 0.05) of Rb+ can be included in FAPbI3, and higher concentrations lead to phase segregation. 
Devices based on Rb-mixed FAPbI3(i.e., Rb0.05 FA0.95 PbI3) outperform those based on FAPbI3, 
and more importantly, the stability of this Rb0.05FA0.95PbI3 film, as shown in Figure 15, 
against humid conditions is superior to that of Cs0.05 FA0.95 PbI3.

Questions：
1. Expanding the crystal a bit, resulting in decreased Pb−I bond distance, which eventually lowers the band gap.
    We knew VBM consisted of Pb 6s-I 5p and CBM consisted of Pb 6p and/or Pb 6p-I 5p. So what the mechanism of that?
  My answers:  The decrease of  Pb−I bond distance caused the orbital overlap between Pb and I, 
                        so the CBM would be expanded and close to VBM which resulted in the band gap decreasing 
                        because the energy band formed by orbital overlap. The orbital overlap increasing leads to the inner shell orbital overlap, 
                        and the energy level splitting was increased, which further leads to VB shift down 
                        (the increased number of electrons less than the increased number of orbits, e.g. two s-orbit overlap with 4 electrons, 
                         there are 4 splitted orbits, considering the spin 自旋 of electron there would be two orbits became the CB 
                         while the bottom two orbits became the VB, but the initial 4 orbits origined from the original VB)
